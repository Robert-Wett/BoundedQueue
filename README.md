BoundedQueue
============

#### An ActionScript 3 Bounded Queue Implementation

Implements a FIFO queue that is optionally capacity bound.  The queue also enforces type safety for all entries by designating the queue object class type in the constructor.  ActionScript 3 does not intrinsically support templates/generics other than the `Vector` class but this convention serves the same purpose for this object.
